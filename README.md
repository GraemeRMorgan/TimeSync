##  TimeSync 

The purpose of this application is to simulate the complexity of time synchronization using a time server. The goal is to have multiple nodes moving across the screen. The uppermost Node represents a time server. The goal is to align all of the nodes in a line. At that point, it is assumed that the time has synchronized across the system. 

This was a University project and gave me an opportunity to learn React.js, as well as many javascript packages.

### Heroku
